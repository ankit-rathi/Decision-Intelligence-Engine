# Chapter 6 — Data Integration

## Fragmented Observations Across Organizational Systems

* Modern organizations operate through many specialized systems built for specific operational tasks.
* Examples include:

  * sales systems recording transactions
  * marketing platforms tracking campaigns
  * operational systems monitoring logistics or manufacturing
  * support systems managing customer interactions
* Each system captures a **narrow slice of organizational activity**, optimized for operational efficiency rather than analytical completeness.
* As a result, data is scattered across multiple databases, applications, and services.
* These systems rarely share a unified structure, meaning the same entities may appear differently in different systems.
* Without integration, analysts and decision-makers see **fragmented observations rather than a coherent representation of the organization**.

---

## Connecting Partial Views into a Unified Dataset

* Data integration is the process of combining data from multiple sources into a unified and consistent dataset.
* The objective is not merely to collect data, but to **connect observations that originate in different systems**.
* Integration makes it possible to reconstruct processes that span multiple systems, such as:

  * the full customer lifecycle
  * supply chain operations
  * product usage and support interactions
* Achieving this requires:

  * aligning entity identifiers across systems
  * reconciling differences in data formats
  * consolidating multiple event streams into a shared structure
* Once integrated, datasets begin to reflect the organization as **an interconnected system of activities rather than isolated operational silos**.

---

## The Data Pipeline: Moving and Transforming Information

* Integration is typically implemented through **data pipelines** that move data from operational systems into analytical environments.

* These pipelines generally involve three core stages:

  * **Extraction** – retrieving data from source systems such as databases, APIs, or event streams.
  * **Transformation** – cleaning, standardizing, and reshaping data into a consistent format.
  * **Loading** – storing the transformed data in a central repository such as a data warehouse or data lake.

* Pipelines may operate in different modes depending on requirements:

  * **Batch processing** for periodic updates
  * **Streaming pipelines** for near real-time data movement

* Reliable pipelines ensure that integrated datasets remain **continuously updated as new events occur**.

---

## Maintaining Consistency Across Evolving Systems

* Integration is not a one-time task but an ongoing process that must adapt as systems evolve.
* Operational systems frequently change:

  * schemas evolve
  * new attributes are added
  * systems are replaced or upgraded
* Integration pipelines must handle these changes without breaking downstream datasets.
* This requires:

  * schema management and version control
  * monitoring pipelines for failures or inconsistencies
  * maintaining documentation of data transformations
* Sustained integration efforts ensure that unified datasets remain **reliable representations of organizational activity over time**.

---

## Revealing System-Level Relationships Through Integration

* Once datasets from different systems are combined, previously hidden relationships become visible.
* Analysts can connect events across domains, enabling insights such as:

  * linking marketing campaigns to sales outcomes
  * connecting product usage patterns with customer churn
  * tracing operational delays back to upstream causes
* Integrated datasets allow organizations to move from **isolated metrics to system-level analysis**.
* This shift transforms data from a collection of operational records into a **comprehensive view of organizational behavior**.

### Explanation

The diagram illustrates how **data integration connects multiple operational systems into a unified dataset**.

* Independent systems each produce their own datasets.
* Data pipelines extract information from these systems.
* Transformation processes standardize formats and connect related entities.
* The integrated result becomes a **unified dataset** that reflects the organization’s activities across systems.

This unified dataset allows analysts and decision systems to observe relationships that were previously hidden within isolated systems.

### Guidance for Drawing in PowerPoint

Layout:

* Use a **top-to-bottom flow** with multiple systems feeding into a pipeline.

Shapes:

* Rectangles for source systems:

  * Sales System
  * Marketing System
  * Operations System
* A rectangle labeled **Data Extraction** below them.
* A rectangle labeled **Data Transformation** beneath extraction.
* A rectangle labeled **Unified Dataset** at the bottom.
* Final rectangle labeled **Organization-Wide View**.

Arrows:

* Arrows from each source system pointing toward the extraction stage.
* Downward arrows connecting each stage of the pipeline.

Design suggestions:

* Place the source systems horizontally at the top.
* Use a consistent color for pipeline stages.
* Keep the layout symmetrical and uncluttered.

## Example Section — Integrating Customer Data Across Systems

Consider how an online retailer integrates customer data from multiple systems.

Three independent systems produce relevant data:

* **E-commerce platform**

  * records purchases and orders

* **Marketing automation system**

  * tracks email campaigns and website visits

* **Customer support platform**

  * logs service requests and complaints

Mapping this example to the diagram:

1. **Source Systems**

   * The sales platform records purchase events.
   * The marketing system tracks campaign engagement.
   * The support system records customer tickets.

2. **Data Extraction**

   * Data pipelines retrieve records from each system’s database or API.

3. **Data Transformation**

   * Customer identifiers are standardized across systems.
   * Data formats and timestamps are normalized.
   * Events are linked to the same customer entity.

4. **Unified Dataset**

   * All customer-related events are combined into a central data platform.

5. **Organization-Wide View**

   * Analysts can now observe the full customer lifecycle:

     * marketing exposure
     * purchasing behavior
     * support interactions

Without integration, each system would provide only a partial view of customer activity.

## Final Section — Seeing the Organization as an Interconnected System

* Organizations generate data across many independent systems, each capturing a limited perspective.
* Data integration connects these partial observations into unified datasets that reveal relationships across processes.
* Through pipelines that extract, transform, and load data, fragmented records become part of a coherent analytical environment.
* When integration is successful, the organization becomes observable as a **connected system of events, entities, and processes**.

In the next chapter, the focus moves from integration to **data storage and organization**.
Once datasets are unified, they must be structured so that analysts and decision systems can efficiently query, explore, and interpret them.
